# Eye Exercise

These eyes get lots of exercise following your mouse movements.

## Description

This program uses javascript to dynamically change the style in the dom. It uses mousemove events and translates the position of the mouse to the position of the eye ball.

## How to Run

Move your mouse and the eyeballs will follow you!

## Roadmap to Future Improvements

This game will be enhanced in the future in the following ways:

* Allowing the user to change the eyecolor of the eyes.
* Adding a head around the eyes.
